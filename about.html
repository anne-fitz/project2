                Out of Bounds offers a unique user experience that contrasts with typical websites by challenging the
                way we interact with online content. By using a lens to highlight the limits of what one sees online,
                this website emphasizes how much control standard web interfaces exert over the experience of the site.
                This project challenges that control by promoting user autonomy and critiquing our digital lack of
                freedom. It also serves as a reflection on how technology and other lenses–both literally and
                figuratively–limit our perception of our world.<br><br>
                The ideal user for this site is someone interested in interactive digital experiences and looking for a
                way to challenge their own thinking of how they navigate the web. They will uncover a playful site that
                explores these themes.<br><br>
                The idea of this website came from my own experiences. On my walk to class, I noticed that everyone
                around me was glued to their phones, seemingly unaware of their surroundings. It made me think how much
                they must miss by just focusing on the rectangle in front of them. This thought evolved and I considered
                the ways in which distorted viewpoints lead to people missing the whole picture: how we only see curated
                images online and miss people's true realities; how rose-colored glasses in a relationship can shield us
                from red flags; how tunnel vision on bigger life milestones can cause us to not appreciate the smaller
                moments of life. Similarly, websites control what you see and experience as well: you can only click on
                what the designer created. Through this website, I wanted to explore the idea of control and perception
                and craft an experience where users can actively uncover content for themselves. The user uses lenses to
                display or hide different parts of the page, able to see both through a distorted view and the entire
                picture.<br><br>
                I consider there to be many conceptual limitations to this project. It is abstract and the
                metaphor is not quite intuitive. I struggled with conceptualizing the whole idea myself and then
                implementing it in code. I think that the website could be clearer and the
                have more nuanced interactivity to further highlight the limitations of our current web
                experiences.<br><br>
                In the next iteration of this website, I would love to fix the aesthetic of it. I used images from
                Pinterest but I would love to make my own content that better aligns with the meaning and is more
                cohesive. Additionally, I’d reconsider the metaphor and ensure that it communicates my vision of letting
                the user uncover content on their own and understand how different perspectives sometimes shield you
                from the whole picture. Lastly, I would want to add mobile responsiveness where it says it's a desktop
                only website when opened on mobile, as I ran out of time for that.
